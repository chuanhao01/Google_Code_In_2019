# [Python/Java/C++/Perl/PHP/Rust] Create and host a local server - SCoRe Lab  

Hi this is the readme for the task `[Python/Java/C++/Perl/PHP/Rust] Create and host a local server - SCoRe Lab`.

For the task, I used mainly Javascript to create and host the localserver.  
The technologies I used were:  
Node.js: [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
Express.js: [Link](http://expressjs.com/)  

The explaintion of the code are comments in the code.  

### Setup
Open a bash/terminal while in the directory and do `npm i`.
To run the server, do `node app.js`
